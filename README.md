# udp-waiting-room

The application as it stands needs some work on input validation and making sure it doesn't crash on unexpected inputs but
apart from that it should work just fine. It is fit for forking and adding to it in some way, probably implementing some 
games or network applications it can actually use. The only application listed is "finger war," but that was never implemented.

Also, some suggestions are made in the project and its code which can be used to improve it. 

This project was submitted as a response to creating a UDP waiting room network application in Java for my Computer Networks Programming 
class in 2022 of my masters at Florida Polytechnic University. 

In this project, I solidified my skills in communicating using a protocol like UDP, multi-threading, and developing server-client programs. 


This project was written in Intellij Idea, and I used Maven to build the project but there aren't any dependencies that I installed because the project doesn't
depend on Maven or resources outside of Java using JDK 18.
